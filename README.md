# Lab 5 Redesign

In Lab 5, our goal was to create a fact sheet on Santa Clara University's MSIS program.

This data visualization could be improved if it was more clear on what my argument was. If I left it as is, the audience wouldn't have a clear idea of what to take action on. Therefore, for my redesign I am going to add explanations to strengthen my argument that MSIS students see a high ROI and are able to because they work at well-known companies.

## New Version:

In the redesigned fact sheet, there are brief explanations of what each metric means. MSIS graduates are in the middle in terms of tuition, but they hold the highest paying salary. Therefore they are able to see a high return on investment. In addition, I added in a short note for the pie chart at the bottom. Graduates are able to see a high ROI because they work at elite companies. These two additions make it easier for prospective students to see why they should enroll in the MSIS program.
