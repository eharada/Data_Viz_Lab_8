# Lab 5 Redesign

In Lab 5, our goal was to create a fact sheet on Santa Clara University's MSIS program.

In this lab, it could be improved if I was more clear on what my argument was. If I left it as is, the audience wouldn't have a clear idea of what to take action on. Therefore, for my redesign I am going to add my arguments and explanations to strengthen my argument that MSIS students see a high ROI and work at cool companies.
