# Updated MSIS Fact Sheet

In Lab 5, our goal was to create a fact sheet on Santa Clara University's MSIS program. In this lab, we are created an updated version to enhance our argument that prospective students should enroll in SCU's MSIS program. 

## Original Version:

This data visualization could be improved if it was more clear on what my argument was. If I left it as is, the audience wouldn't have a clear idea of what to take action on. In addition, there are too many charts so it clutters the fact sheet and might leave the audience confused. Therefore, for my redesign I am going to merge the tuition and salary charts and add explanations to strengthen my argument that MSIS students see a high ROI and are able to because they work at well-known companies.

## New Version:

To get return on investment, we want to compare at the tuition for Santa Clara University against the potential salaries that MSIS alumni earn.

<b> What was changed: </b>
* Added title & updated chart: MSIS alumni see high return on investment after graduation & added the MS programs with the respective job titles
  - This makes it easier for the audience to see what a typical job may be for each program and the audience can also see a clear comparison that shows that MSIS program is "the best bang for the buck"
* Integrated tuition and salaries together to get return on investment calculations
  - This makes it easier for the audience to see the ROI instead of calculating it on their own
* Added explanation: MSIS alumni are able to have high ROI because they work at elite companies
  - Rather than showing which companies are included in the pie chart, we should add an explanation of what the data shows and how it relates to the other chart. This matters because we want to show that our alumni are able to make the most money because a majority of the alumni work at well-known companies.

### Final Fact Sheet:

Prospective students should enroll in the MSIS program because our graduates are able to earn the highest return on investment. Other master's programs at SCU are good, but they don't earn as high of a salary as MSIS alumni. One of the reasons that graduates are able to see a high ROI is because they work at elite companies.
